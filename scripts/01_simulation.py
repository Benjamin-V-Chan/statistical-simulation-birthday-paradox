# Define a function to simulate birthdays for a given group size and trials
    # For each trial:
        # Generate random birthdays for the group
        # Check if any two birthdays match
    # Return the number of trials with matches and total trials

# Define a main function
    # Load configurations for group sizes and number of trials
    # Run simulations for each group size
    # Save results (group size, probability of match) to a CSV file
