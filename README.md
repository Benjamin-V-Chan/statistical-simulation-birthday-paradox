# statistical-simulation-birthday-paradox

## Project Overview

The Birthday Paradox, a counterintuitive probability concept, suggests that in a group of just 23 people, there is a greater than 50% chance that two individuals share the same birthday. This project explores this phenomenon through statistical simulation, data analysis, and visualization. The goal is to understand and analyze the probability of birthday matches as group sizes increase, providing insights into the paradox and its mathematical underpinnings.
